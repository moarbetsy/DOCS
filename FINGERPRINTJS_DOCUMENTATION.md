## Introduction

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/readme.md

FingerprintJS is an open-source, client-side, browser fingerprinting library that queries browser attributes and computes a hashed visitor identifier from them. Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.

FingerprintJS is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/licensing.md).

### Demo

Visit [https://fingerprintjs.github.io/fingerprintjs](https://fingerprintjs.github.io/fingerprintjs) to see your visitor identifier.

Now, try visiting the same page in private / incognito mode and notice how the visitor identifier remains the **same**!

### Getting Started

```html
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  // If you're using an ad blocker or Brave/Firefox, this import will not work.
  // Please use the NPM package instead: https://t.ly/ORyXk
  const fpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5')
    .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load())

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => {
      // This is the visitor identifier:
      const visitorId = result.visitorId
      console.log(visitorId)
    })
</script>
```

### Limitations

#### Accuracy

Since FingerprintJS processes and generates the fingerprints from within the browser itself, the accuracy is significantly lower than in the [commercial version](https://fingerprint.com/pricing)

#### Security

Because of how the fingerprints are processed and generated from within the browser itself, they are vulnerable to spoofing and reverse engineering.

### Industry-leading accuracy with Fingerprint Identification

The main difference between FingerprintJS and [Fingerprint Identification](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/introduction) lies in the number of attributes collected from the browser, how they are processed, and the accuracy in identifying visitors.

Fingerprint Identification is a **closed-source**, **commercial** device intelligence platform designed to prevent fraud and improve user experiences. It's an enhanced version of FingerprintJS and has been fully re-designed to solve the most challenging identification use cases. Its source is not available in this or any other public repository.

Unlike FingerprintJS, Fingerprint Identification is able to achieve **industry-leading accuracy** because it processes the browser attributes on the server and also analyzes vast amounts of auxiliary data (e.g. IP addresses, time of visit patterns, URL changes, etc.). Because of these advanced matching techniques, Fingerprint Identification is able to reliably deduplicate different visitors that have identical devices.

Fingerprint Identification is available for Web, Android, iOS, and other platforms. You can easily get started by [signing up](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup) for a free, unlimited 14-day trial.

Check out our [comparison table](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/comparison.md) for a detailed breakdown of the differences between FingerprintJS and Fingerprint Identification.

## API Reference

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/api.md

### Installation

The library supports all the popular installation methods:

#### Browser ECMAScript module

```html
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  // You can also use https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/esm.min.js
  const fpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5')
    .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load())

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
</script>
```

#### Browser `<script>` tag

A synchronous code that pauses the other scripts during loading and therefore not recommended:

```html
<!-- Note that we use iife.min.js -->
<script src="https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/iife.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  var fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

  // Analyze the visitor when necessary.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
</script>
```

#### UMD

```javascript
require(
  ['https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/umd.min.js'],
  FingerprintJS => {
    // Initialize the agent at application startup.
    const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

    // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
    fpPromise
      .then(fp => fp.get())
      .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
  }
)
```

#### Webpack/Rollup/NPM/Yarn

```bash
# Install the package first:
npm i @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

```javascript
import FingerprintJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs'

// Initialize an agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

;(async () => {
  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  const fp = await fpPromise
  const result = await fp.get()
  console.log(result.visitorId)
})()
```

**When you run FingerprintJS installed with NPM or Yarn, the library will send AJAX requests to FingerprintJS servers to collect usage statistics.**
When the `load` function runs, there is a 0.1% chance of sending a request.
The requests are sent at most once a week from one browser instance (unless the browser cache was cleared).
A request includes the following information:

- The library version
- The HTTP headers that the client sends, including the origin and the referrer of the page where the library runs
- The IP of the client

If you have a TypeScript error that occurs in a FingerprintJS file,
see the [TypeScript support guide](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/typescript_support.md).

CommonJS syntax (outdated):

```javascript
const FingerprintJS = require('@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs')

// Initialize the agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

// Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
fpPromise
  .then(fp => fp.get())
  .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
```

### API

#### `FingerprintJS.load({ delayFallback?: number, debug?: boolean }): Promise<Agent>`

Builds an instance of Agent and waits a delay required for a proper operation.
We recommend calling it as soon as possible.
`delayFallback` is an optional parameter that sets duration (milliseconds) of the fallback for browsers that don't support [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback);
it has a good default value which we don't recommend to change.
`debug: true` prints debug messages to the console.

#### `agent.get(): Promise<GetResult>`

A method of an Agent instance that gets the visitor identifier.
We recommend calling it later, when you really need the identifier, to increase the chance of getting an accurate identifier.
The returned object format:

```typescript
interface GetResult {
  visitorId: string
  confidence: {
    score: number
    comment?: string
  }
  components: {
    [key: string]:
      { value: any, duration: number } |
      { error: any, duration: number }
  }
  version: string
}
```

The returned object fields:

- `visitorId` The visitor identifier
- `confidence`.`score` The confidence score.
This is a number between 0 and 1 that tells how much the agent is sure about the visitor identifier.
The higher the number, the higher the chance of the visitor identifier to be true.
- `confidence`.`comment` Additional information for the confidence score. A human-readable text.
- `components` A dictionary of components that have formed the identifier.
The keys are the component names.
`value` is a component value (in case of success).
`error` is an error object (in case of an unexpected error during getting the component).
- `version` The fingerprinting algorithm version which is equal to the library version.
See [the version policy guide](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/version_policy.md) for more details.

See the [extending guide](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/extending.md) to learn how to remove and add entropy components.

#### `FingerprintJS.hashComponents(components: object): string`

Converts a dictionary of components (described above) into a short hash string a.k.a. a visitor identifier.
Designed for [extending the library](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/extending.md) with your own components.

#### `FingerprintJS.componentsToDebugString(components: object): string`

Converts a dictionary of components (described above) into human-friendly format.

### Working with code

This section describes how to deploy the repository locally, make changes to the code, and verify your work.

First, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
Then clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs.git
cd fingerprintjs
yarn install
```

#### Development playground

Development playground lets you run FingerprintJS locally. Run this command to start a playground:

```bash
yarn playground:start # Add '--port 8765' to change the server port
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in a browser.
FingerprintJS will execute immediately and print the result on the page.
The page reloads every time you change the source code.
The code of the playground itself is located in the [playground](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/playground) directory.

If you want to open the playground on a device outside your local network, use a tool like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

To build the playground distribution code (e.g. to upload it to a web server), run:

```bash
yarn playground:build
```

The static webpage files will be saved to the `playground/dist` directory.

#### Code style

Follow the repository's code style.
The code style is controlled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
Run to check that the code style is ok:

```bash
yarn lint
```

You aren't required to run the check manually, the CI will do it.
Run to fix code style mistakes (not all mistakes can be fixed automatically):

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

#### How to build

To build the distribution files of FingerprintJS that can be used in a browser directly, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

The files will be saved to the `dist` directory.

#### Pitfalls

Avoid running expressions in the top level of the modules.
It will help to tree-shake the library better:

```javascript
// Ok. Will be removed if not used.
function do() {
  // Any expression inside a function is ok
}

// Ok. Will be removed if not used.
const var1 = { prop: 'foo' }

// No! A function is called, the function call won't be removed.
const var2 = Object.keys(var1)

// No! An object property is accessed, the expression won't be removed because the property may be a getter.
const var3 = var1.prop

// No! Will be converted to `const var4 = {}; var4.bar = 'foo'`.
const var4 = { [Enum.Member]: 'foo' }
```

Avoid using `navigator.userAgent` or similar APIs, as they are frequently spoofed.
Instead, for code that makes decisions based on browser name and version, use the functions available in [src/utils/browser.ts](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/src/utils/browser.ts).
However, in tests, for greater reliability, use `navigator.userAgent` through the functions in [tests/utils/index.ts](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/tests/utils/index.ts).

The `include` parameter of `tsconfig.json` files may contain only the entry files and the `.d.ts` files.

Some `interface`s are replaced with `type`s in the entropy sources to help to avoid
["cannot be named" errors](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5711) in projects using FingerprintJS.

#### How to test

There are automatic tests.
They are run by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) in real browsers using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/).
Unit test files are located right next to individual module files that they check.
Integration tests are located in the `tests` directory.

To run the tests in a browser on your machine, build the project and run:

```bash
yarn test:local --browsers ChromeHeadless
# or to run in Firefox
yarn test:local --browsers FirefoxHeadless
# or to run in both
yarn test:local
```

To run the tests in browsers on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), get a BrowserStack access key and run:

```bash
# For Linux, macOS and WSL (Linux on Windows)
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your-username BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your-key yarn test:browserstack
```

If you face `Error: spawn Unknown system error -86` on macOS, try installing Rosetta:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

Alternatively, make a PR to this repository, the test will run on BrowserStack automatically.
But the test won't run when the PR is made from a fork repository, in this case, a member will run the tests manually.

BrowserStack sessions are unstable, so a session can fail for no reason;
restart the testing when you see no clear errors related to the tests.
If you run the test command multiple times in parallel, BrowserStack will lose access to the Karma server
(for some reason), which will cause the tests to hang infinitely, so try to run a single test command at once.

To check the distribution TypeScript declarations, build the project and run:

```bash
yarn check:dts
```

To check that the package is compatible with server-side rendering, build the project and run:

```bash
yarn check:ssr
```

#### How to add an entropy source

An entropy source is a function that gets a piece of data about the browser.
The value returned by an entropy source (also called an entropy component) is used to produce the visitor identifier.
Entropy sources are located in the [src/sources](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/src/sources) directory.
All entropy components must be simple JavaScript values that can be encoded into JSON.

Entropy sources must meet the following requirements:

- It is stable — it always or almost always produces the same value in each browser, including incognito, guest, and desktop modes.
- It is selective — it produces different values in different browsers, operating systems, or devices.
A good entropy source represents the browser, operating system, or device settings.
- It produces no side effects, such as messages in the browser console, DOM changes, modal windows, notifications, and sounds.
- It is fast. An entropy source should take no more than 1 second to complete.
- It doesn't represent only the browser version. An example of such a signal is a JavaScript feature probing.
It's not a good entropy source because the return value is likely to change due to automatic browser updates,
the selectivity is low, and the same entropy can be achieved by just using the User-Agent string.

Entropy sources run in 2 stages: "load" and "get":

- "Load" runs once when the agent's `load` function is called.
It must do as much work on the source as possible to make the "get" phase as fast as possible.
It may start background processes that will run indefinitely or until the "get" phase runs.
- "Get" runs once per each agent's `get` function call.
It must be as fast as possible.

An example entropy source:

```javascript
// The function below represents the "load" phase
async function entropySource() {
  // The "load" phase starts here
  const preData = await doLongAction()

  // The "load" phase ends when the `entropySource` function returns
  // The function below represents the "get" phase
  return async () => {
    // The "get" phase starts here
    const finalData = await finalizeData(preData)
    return finalData
    // The "get" phase ends then this returned function returns
  }
}
```

Any of the phases can be synchronous:

```javascript
function entropySource() {
  const preData = doLongSynchronousAction()

  return () => {
    const finalData = finalizeDataSynchronously(preData)
    return finalData
  }
}
```

The "get" phase can be omitted:

```javascript
async function entropySource() {
  const finalData = await doLongAction()

  // If the source's returned value is not a function, it's considered an entropy component
  return finalData // Equivalent to: return () => finalData
}
```

In fact, most entropy sources don't require a "get" phase.
The "get" phase is required if the component can change after completing the load phase.

In order for the agent to measure the entropy source execution duration correctly,
the "load" phase shouldn't run in the background (after the source function returns).
On the other hand, in order not to block the whole agent, the "load" phase must contain only the necessary actions.
Example:

```javascript
async function entropySource() {
  // Wait for the required data to be calculated during the "load" phase
  let result = await doLongAction()

  // Start watching optional data in the background (this function doesn't block the execution)
  watchNextResults((newResult) => {
    result = newResult
  })

  // Then complete the "load" phase by returning a function.
  // `watchNextResults` will continue working until the "get" phase starts.
  return () => {
    return result
  }
}
```

Entropy sources must handle expected and only expected errors.
The expected errors must be turned into special entropy component values.
Pay attention to potential asynchronous errors.
If you handle unexpected errors, you won't know what's going wrong inside the entropy source.
Example:

```javascript
async function entropySource() {
  try {
    // `await` is necessary to catch asynchronous errors
    return await doLongAction()
  } catch (error) {
    // WRONG:
    return 'error'

    // Correct:
    if (error.message = 'Foo bar') {
      return 'bot'
    }
    if (/boo/.test(error.message)) {
      return 'ie'
    }
    throw error // Unexpected error
  }
}
```

When you complete an entropy source, add it to [src/sources/index.ts](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/src/sources/index.ts).

Every entropy source needs to be covered with unit tests.
These tests are meant to verify that the entropy source returns expected values across all supported browsers.
In the event of significant changes or deprecation of underlying APIs, these tests should start to fail in future browser versions.
Additionally, if deemed necessary, it's recommended to include a test to ensure that the entropy source remains stable.

For inspiration see existing tests in [src/sources/](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/src/sources).

## Browser Support

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/browser_support.md

The library supports all popular browsers.
We aim to cover at least 99% of all users according to the Fingerprint Pro statistics.

At the moment, these browsers are:

- **Edge** 105+
- **Chrome** 73+
- **Firefox** 89+
- **Desktop Safari** 13.0+
- **Mobile Safari** 13.0+
- **Samsung Internet** 14.0+

Other browsers will probably also work, but we don't guarantee it.

## Comparison: FingerprintJS vs. Fingerprint Identification

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/comparison.md

The main difference between FingerprintJS and [Fingerprint Identification](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/introduction) lies in the number of attributes collected from the browser, how they are processed, and the accuracy in identifying visitors.

Compared to FingerprintJS, Fingerprint Identification has numerous advantages. The table below compares and contrasts these two products:

| | FingerprintJS | Fingerprint Identification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ### Core Features |
| **Basic identification input signals**<br>_(screen, os, device name)_ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Advanced identification input signals**<br>_(canvas, audio, fonts)_ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Smart signals (output)**<br>_(Bot detection, device, network, and user behavior)_ | - | **✓** |
| **ID Type** | fingerprint | visitorID** |
| **ID Lifetime** | Only upto a few weeks | Will last several months and sometimes years |
| **ID Origin** | Client | Server |
| **ID Collisions** | Quite common | Very rare |

**In comparison to fingerprints, VisitorIDs are more accurate and stable identifiers because they are deduplicated, are processed further on the server, and utilize fuzzy matching.
On the other hand, fingerprint hashes become unstable across time intervals greater than 2 weeks because they rely on an exact match of all browser attributes.

***The company, Fingerprint, in its role as data processor is compliant with GDPR, CCPA and SOC 2 Type II. It is also ISO 27001 certified.
As a data controller, it is still your responsibility to be compliant with GDPR and CCPA and use the identification result for legitimate purposes.

## Content Blockers

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/content_blockers.md

The page shows how to maintain content blockers entropy sources.

The entropy sources work only in Safari and on all Android browsers
because other browsers disable extensions in incognito mode and therefore the sources would be unstable.

### List of filters

Filter is a list of rules that tell browser what to block.
Filters are written using a common standard: [AdBlock Plus syntax](https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters).
Most ad blockers use this syntax, so the filters are universal.

See the filters that we consider (the most popular filters) in [filters.ts](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/resources/content_blocking/filters.ts).

### DOM blockers

This entropy source checks which DOM elements (CSS selectors) are blocked by browsers.
The source code is at `src/sources/dom_blockers.ts`.
It contains a list of filters and CSS selectors to detect.
This list should be actualized periodically.

#### How to make the list of filters

##### 1. Make a selectors tester

The open a terminal, go to the repository root and run:

```bash
yarn install
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node --compiler-options '{"esModuleInterop": true}' ./resources/content_blocking/make_selectors_tester.ts
```

It will download all the filters and
create an HTML file at `resources/content_blocking/selectors_tester.html`.

##### 2. Get selectors blocked by each filter

Install an ad blocker where you can choose individual filters to use.
We strongly recommend to use AdGuard on iOS or macOS because AdGuard allows choosing individual filters,
includes all the filters above, and iOS is the №1 target of the entropy source
(macOS version works the same but allows custom filters in free version).

Open the HTML file created above in the browser.
AdGuard in Safari works well if you just open the local file directly.
You can use [ngrok](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58547760/1118709) to open the file on another device.

For each filter in the list mentioned above, do the following steps:

1. Go to the ab blocker settings, turn on only this filter, make sure the new filter set is applied (click the refresh button in the ad blocker settings and wait a couple seconds).
2. Return to the browser, refresh the page (make sure the field content has changed). It will show which CSS selectors are blocked by the current filter.
If the list is empty, try refreshing the page or opening it on another platform.
3. Save the content of the field to a `.txt` file in the `resources/content_blocking/blocked_selectors` directory.
The file names will be names of the filters in the entropy source; see its source code to know the correct names.

After that, you will get the list of files that matches the current list of filters in the entropy source code.

##### 3. Get unique selectors for each filter

Open a terminal, go to the repository root and run:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node ./resources/content_blocking/get_unique_filter_selectors.ts
```

A JSON file will be created at `resources/content_blocking/unique_filter_selectors.json`.
This file contains unique blocked selectors for each of the filters.

Runs this command to insert the unique selectors into `src/sources/dom_blockers.ts`:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node ./resources/content_blocking/insert_filter_code.ts
```

Take a look into the changes of the `src/sources/dom_blockers.ts` file.
Make sure that no excess filters are added, renamed or removed.

##### 4. EasyList Android case

AdGuard on Android blocks slightly different selectors than AdGuard on iOS.
Sometimes it leads to false positive EasyList detection when AdGuard Base filter is used.

To solve it, you need an Android device or emulator with AdGuard installed.
Do the step 3, but copy all the selectors of EasyList to `src/sources/dom_blockers.ts` manually.
On the device, enable AdGuard, open the settings and enable a few filters including AdGuard Base but not including EasyList.
Start the playground, connect Chrome (or any other browser) debugger to the device, open the device browser console,
check which of the selectors are passed (see more detail about the debugging below) and copy 5 of them to the entropy source code.

If you don't have an ability to use an Android device/emulator,
just check that the current EasyList selectors don't give false positive using the debugging.

### Debug

If you run agent in debug mode (e.g. on the playground), the entropy source will print which CSS selectors are blocked and which aren't.
The selectors are grouped into filters (according to the entropy source code).
➡️ right to a selector means that it isn't blocked, 🚫 means that it's blocked.
You can adjust your ad blocker settings and see what changes.
Ideally, each filter must block all of its selectors and none of the other selectors.

## Evade Ad Blockers

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/evade_ad_blockers.md

Some ad blockers might detect and block this library because of the known CDN URL or the script name.
To evade the specific detection, one needs to check the applied rules.
Here are some generic options to circumvent this behavior.

### Open-source alternatives

- Use the [NPM installation option](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/api.md#webpackrollupnpmyarn) for the open source FingerprintJS.
- The less preferred way is to self-host the script on your own domain. It will make your script quickly outdated and it will stop working with new browsers as they get released in the future. Additionally, make sure the script's URL doesn't end with the `/fingerprint.js`, otherwise it will be blocked.
You can find scripts on the following URLs (you can replace the version with the specific version e.g. with `v5.0.0`).

  - ES Module download URL: `https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/esm.min.js`.
  - UMD download URL: `https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/umd.min.js`.

### Commercial alternatives

- Sign up for a [14-day free trial](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup) of Fingerprint Pro, which includes unlimited API calls. This includes both the CDN and NPM installation options as well as a [custom subdomain](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/subdomain-integration) that will prevent blocking of ad blockers.
- Use the [paid tier for Fingerprint Identification](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup), which allows making an unlimited number of identification events per month. This option supports both CDN and NPM installation options and the [custom subdomain](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/subdomain-integration) functionality too.

## Extending FingerprintJS

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/extending.md

You can exclude built-in entropy components and add custom entropy components,
for example, when a component is too unstable for your needs.
Use the built-in hash function to hash your custom list of components.

An example of component exclusion:

```javascript
// ...

const result = await fp.get()

// The `languages` and `audio` components will be excluded
const { languages, audio, ...components } = result.components

// Optionally, you can make a visitor identifier from your custom list of components
const visitorId = FingerprintJS.hashComponents(components)
```

An example of component addition:

```javascript
// ...

const result = await fp.get()

// New components will be added: `foo` and `bar`.
// You should implement the `getFooComponent` and `getBarComponent` functions by yourself,
// they can return any value.
const components = {
  ...result.components,
  foo: { value: await getFooComponent() },
  bar: { value: await getBarComponent() },
}

// Optionally, you can make a visitor identifier from your custom list of components
const visitorId = FingerprintJS.hashComponents(components)
```

An example of both component exclusion and addition:

```javascript
// ...

const result = await fp.get()

// The `languages` and `audio` components will be excluded
const { languages, audio, ...components } = result.components

// New components will be added: `foo` and `bar`
const extendedComponents = {
  ...components,
  foo: { value: await getFooComponent() },
  bar: { value: await getBarComponent() },
}

// Optionally, you can make a visitor identifier from your custom list of components
const visitorId = FingerprintJS.hashComponents(extendedComponents)
```

You can format your custom list of components into a human-friendly text:

```javascript
// ...

const debugOutput = document.querySelector('pre')
debugOutput.textContent = FingerprintJS.componentsToDebugString(components)
```

### Canvas stabilization

The [canvas entropy source](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/src/sources/canvas.ts) consists of 2 images.
The first (with a geometry only) is more stable, the second (with a text) gives more entropy.
Agent uses both the images by default.
If you need more stability, you can exclude the text image.
Example:

```javascript
// ...

let { components } = await fp.get()

if ('value' in components.canvas) {
  components.canvas.value.text = ''
}

// Optionally, you can make a visitor identifier from your custom list of components
const visitorId = FingerprintJS.hashComponents(components)
```

## Publishing Guide

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/publishing.md

This guide is for repository maintainers.

1. Create a PR that bumps the version in [package.json](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/package.json).
2. [Build the project](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/contributing.md#how-to-build) on your local machine and run `yarn pack`.
An archive will be created nearby in the repository root directory.
Open the archive and make sure it contains the distribution files and no excess files.
If there is something wrong, fix it and push to the PR.
3. When the PR checks succeed and the PR is approved, merge it.
4. Run the [Publish to NPM](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/actions/workflows/npm_publish.yml) workflow by using the "Run workflow" button.
It will publish the current code to NPM and create a corresponding Git tag.
The NPM version tag will be derived automatically from the package version, for example `1.2.3` gives `latest` and `1.2.3-alpha.1` gives `alpha`.
5. Describe the version changes in the [releases section](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/releases) under the corresponding tag.
6. Update the agent in [https://stackblitz.com/edit/fpjs-5-npm](https://stackblitz.com/edit/fpjs-5-npm) (find "dependencies" and click the round arrow).

## TypeScript Support

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/typescript_support.md

FingerprintJS has built-in TypeScript types.
In order to use them, just install the library and import it in a `.ts` file:

```bash
npm i @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

```typescript
import FingerprintJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs'
```

FingerprintJS officially supports TypeScript version 5.1,
but may work with newer and older versions of TypeScript.
If you face a TypeScript error that occurs in a `.d.ts` file provided by FingerprintJS
( [example 1](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/issues/651), [example 2](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/issues/653)),
consider any of these solutions:

- Update the TypeScript package in your project to version 5.1 or newer

```bash
npm i typescript@^5.1
# or
yarn add typescript@^5.1
```

- Prevent TypeScript from using the library types. To do it, replace

```typescript
import ... from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs'
```

with

```typescript
import ... from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/dist/fp.esm'
```

in your `.ts` files, and add the following line to a `.d.ts` file (if there is no such file, create one anywhere with any name):

```typescript
declare module '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/dist/fp.esm'
```

---

## Version Policy

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/version_policy.md

The documented JS API follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Use undocumented features at your own risk.

### Visitor identifier compatibility

The library tries to keep visitor identifiers the same within a minor version (i.e. when the first 2 numbers of the version don't change).
Some visitor identifiers may change within a minor version due to stability fixes.
To get identifiers that remain stable up to 1 year, please consider [upgrading to pro](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/).

Agent `get()` function returns the version together with the visitor identifier.
You can use it to decide whether a couple of identifiers can be matched together.
Example:

```javascript
if (
  result1.version.split('.', 2).join('.') ===
  result2.version.split('.', 2).join('.')
) {
  return result1.visitorId === result2.visitorId ? 'same' : 'different'
} else {
  return 'unknown'
}
```

### How to update without losing the identifiers

We recommend keeping your library version up to date.
You may not want to update because the identifier may change after a minor version upgrade.
If this is an issue for you, you can implement the following strategy.

When a new minor or major version is released, install it together with the current version:

```javascript
const oldFpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5.1')
  .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load())

const newFpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v6.0')
  .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load())
```

(if you prefer NPM or Yarn, see [this note](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56495651/1118709))

When you need the visitor identifier, get identifiers from both versions:

```javascript
Promise.all([
  oldFpPromise.then(fp => fp.get()),
  newFpPromise.then(fp => fp.get()),
]).then(([oldResult, newResult]) => {
  // Handle both the results. For example, send to your server.
  return fetch(
    '/visitor'
      + `?fingerprintV4_1=${encodeURIComponent(oldResult.visitorId)}`
      + `&fingerprintV5_0=${encodeURIComponent(newResult.visitorId)}`
  )
})
```

Make your server search using both the identifiers.
Save the new identifier, there is no need to save the old identifier for new visitors:

```sql
-- Getting the visitor
SELECT * FROM visitors
WHERE
  fingerprintV4_1 = :fingerprintV4_1 OR
  fingerprintV5_0 = :fingerprintV5_0;

-- Update the visitor identifier
-- to switch to the new fingerprint version
UPDATE visitors
SET fingerprintV5_0 = :fingerprintV5_0
WHERE fingerprintV4_1 = :fingerprintV4_1;

-- Saving a new visitor
INSERT INTO visitors (..., fingerprintV5_0)
VALUES (..., :fingerprintV5_0);
```

Later, when you get many enough identifiers of the new version, remove the old library and the old identifiers.

Check [the changelog](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/releases) before the update, sometimes new minor
versions don't change the identifiers, so just changing the library version may suffice.

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v3 to v5

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/migration/v3_v5.md

This guide shows how to migrate your code from FingerprintJS version 3 to version 5.
The API and the installations methods are almost the same in both version.

#### Installation

The migration process depends on the way you install the library.

##### CDN

Change the version number in the URL from `3` to `5`. For example:

```
- https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v3/iife.min.js
+ https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/iife.min.js
```

##### NPM or Yarn

Update the package version:

```bash
npm install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

#### API

##### Entropy source unexpected error handling

If you don't handle errors in `components` field of `get()` result, skip this section.

In version 3 unexpected entropy source errors were coerced to a `{ message: any }` object,
so that the `error` field of a component object is always truthy in case of unexpected error.

In version 5 the caught error is put into the `error` field as is.
The presence of error should be checked using the `'error' in component` syntax:

```javascript
- if (component.error) {
+ if ('error' in component) {
    console.log('Unexpected error in the component', component.error)
  }
```

TypeScript supports type-guarding using `in` keyword since [version 4.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#in-narrowing),
so the above code snippet works in TypeScript just fine.

This example shows the `get()` result difference in case when the error is a falsy value, which is very unlikely:

```javascript
const result = {
  visitorId: '...',
  components: {
    failedComponent: {
-     error: { message: '' },
+     error: '',
      duration: 10,
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

#### How to update without losing the identifiers

The process is the same as for minor version update.
See the [version policy guide](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/version_policy.md#how-to-update-without-losing-the-identifiers).

---

### Migrating from v4 to v5

Source: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/migration/v4_v5.md

This guide covers the changes required to upgrade your application from FingerprintJS version 4 to version 5.

#### License

The license for FingerprintJS v5 has **changed** from ~~BSL 1.1~~ to **MIT license**. The MIT license enables you to

- Use FingerprintJS v5 for research / non-commercial purposes
- Use FingerprintJS v5 in production without a commercial agreement
- Fork and self-host FingerprintJS v5 in production

See the complete licensing statement in [docs/licensing.md](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/docs/licensing.md) for additional details.

#### Installation

The migration process depends on the way you install the library.

##### CDN

Change the version number in the URL from `4` to `5`. For example:

```
- https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v4/iife.min.js
+ https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/iife.min.js
```

##### NPM or Yarn

Update the package version:

```bash
npm install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

#### JavaScript output and browser support

##### Updated compilation target

The distributed bundles are now compiled to ES2018 instead of ES5. Modern build tools already handle this target, but any pipeline that assumed ES5 output (for example, older minifiers or ES5-only runtime environments) may require updates to accept or transpile ES2018 syntax.

##### Supported browsers

The minimum browser versions officially supported by FingerprintJS are listed in the [browser and device support guide](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/browser-and-device-support#browsers). Confirm that the browsers you rely on meet or exceed these versions before deploying v5.

##### Transpiling to ES5 when required

If you must keep ES5-compatible artifacts—for example, when embedding FingerprintJS into legacy applications—you now need to run that transpilation yourself. A typical setup using Babel might look like:

```json
// babel.config.json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "ie": "11"
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
        "corejs": "3.38"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Or, if you compile with TypeScript, adjust your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "downlevelIteration": true
  }
}
```

Make sure that your bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Vite, etc.) picks up these settings so that the FingerprintJS package is transpiled along with your application code.

For Webpack with `babel-loader`, explicitly include the library so it is processed despite the default `node_modules` exclusion:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules\/(?!@fingerprintjs\/fingerprintjs)/, // this will transpile FingerprintJS
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: [
              [
                '@babel/preset-env',
                {
                  targets: { ie: '11' },
                  useBuiltIns: 'usage',
                  corejs: '3.38'
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you use TypeScript, ensure that the bundler reads your `tsconfig.json` (for example via `ts-loader` or `babel-loader` with `@babel/preset-typescript`) so that the downlevel settings apply to both your code and FingerprintJS.
