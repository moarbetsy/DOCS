#### Creating a Browser Profile

http://support.gologin.com/en/articles/9796666-creating-a-browser-profile

### Why and how does it work?

Different websites use various IP geolocation databases to determine the country of an IP address. These databases are not synchronized, leading to situations where the same IP is detected as belonging to multiple different locations.

Another key factor is whether an IP is flagged as belonging to a Datacenter / VPN / any other service.

If an IP is recognized as a service, it can drastically lower its trust score, making it more likely to be flagged or blocked by websites.

We do not recommend using proxies with the discrepancies listed above.

### How do I check my proxy?

1. Get the outgoing IP of your proxy here, just hover over the arrows icon

2. There are more tools on the Internet, we usually use these two for consistent results:
   - To check the IP geolocation: https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup
   - To check services on the IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/

Examples to determine are below:

#### Valid

![Valid Example](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/izr1nygf/1369872386/696adc00abd65c21a748c62ddc72/image+%2830%29.png)

#### Bad

![Bad Example](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/izr1nygf/1369872304/0dceaa7d858bb4bb6b771e1a4f7b/image+%2829%29.png)

### How to avoid proxy issues

To minimize issues caused by incorrect proxy locations:
- **Use reputable proxy providers** – High-quality providers ensure that their IPs are correctly categorized and registered. You can use GoLogin proxies or the proxies we recommend.
- **Avoid datacenter proxies for sensitive tasks** – Residential or mobile proxies generally have higher trust scores.
- **Test your proxy before using it** – Run it through multiple IP checkers to ensure consistency.
- **Rotate IPs if needed** – If a particular IP is flagged incorrectly, switching to another IP may resolve the issue.

By paying attention to these details, you can ensure a smoother and more reliable experience when using GoLogin.

### Storage on-site and IndexedDB

There is frequently some effort involved in creating the initial application state that is utilized to create the UI when a user first loads a website or application. For instance, there are occasions when the app must first perform client-side user authentication before submitting a number of API queries to obtain all the information required for page display.

It may be quite beneficial to speed up the load time for repeat visitors by storing the application state in IndexedDB. The app may then use a stale-while-revalidate technique to refresh the UI with fresh data while synchronizing with any API services in the background.

You can choose whether to allow the synchronization of your browser profiles with IndexedDB and save data locally in Gologin.

We advise to activate IndexedDB and LocalStorage in order for websites to maintain the consistency of any data they may keep. If this option is deactivated, upon each future browser restart, websites will see that these storages are empty. This can mean that they were eliminated on purpose.

### Extension Storage

Other forms of browser data are kept in a different container from extensions and their accompanying data. Therefore, you must Enable Extension storage if you want to utilize extensions and have them restored each time your browser profile launches.

### Using Extensions

You can utilize browser add-ons similarly to ordinary Chrome and Firefox thanks to Gologin extension feature:

1. Make a new browser profile or choose from your list.
2. Go to the "Extensions" page in the profile settings after choosing a profile from the list.
3. Select your extension, then select "Install".
4. By selecting "Remove," the extension can be reinstalled.
5. Close the window and click "Save".

Check if the installed extension works by restarting the profile. You can see this in the upper corner of the browser's profile window on the right. Particularly with limited internet rates, certain heavyweight addons can cause unusually sluggish browser loading and saving times.

### Cache Storage

You can control the size of the cache in the Gologin account settings. To do this, go to "Cache" and click "Clear Storage".

### Troubleshooting

- if you have the "Email change is not available for this account" error, just get the login and password in addition to your Google Authentication method.

## Cookie Import | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/3452643-cookie-import

A web cookie is a tiny piece of data sent from a website and stored on a user's computer while the user is browsing the internet. This data plays a critical role in verifying the identity of the user. To integrate these cookies into Gologin, you can transfer them from your primary browser.

Initially, it's essential to retrieve cookies from your browser. Gologin's browser is compatible with JSON or Netscape formats, in addition to plain text. Various browser extensions facilitate this process. For those needing to clear cookies from their browsers, numerous free tools are readily accessible online. This discussion will highlight several outstanding and complimentary browser extensions, facilitating the acquisition of a text or JSON file, which Gologin accommodates.

HTTP cookies and web cookies represent distinct varieties of data storage mechanisms, both serving to preserve user information. Through Gologin's "Import Cookies" functionality, you can seamlessly integrate cookies from your main browser into your browser profiles.

### To transfer cookies into Gologin, execute the following steps:

- Access the menu by clicking the three dots adjacent to the "Run" button, then select "Cookies."

- During the creation of a new profile, navigate to the "Cookies" tab and opt for "Cookie Import."

A subsequent window will appear, allowing for the addition of cookies.

**There are two methods to import cookies:**

1. Firstly, through text, by copying the data from the extension and pasting it into the designated field before clicking on import. This action refreshes your cookies.

2. Alternatively, by uploading the file directly.

Be aware that importing a new set of cookies from the same website will eliminate and replace any existing cookies.

### Guidance for Cookie Export and Import

Gologin browser profiles are compatible with JSON and Netscape cookies. For exporting and importing cookies, the following Chrome extensions are recommended:

- EditThisCookie
- Swap My Cookies
- Cookie Editor
- Export History/Bookmarks to JSON/CSV/XLS
- Cookie-Editor

### Instructions for Viewing Cookies in Your Browser

To view cookie files in your browser, utilize the following steps:

- For Chrome, insert "chrome:/settings/siteData" into the address bar.

- For Firefox, input "about:preferences#privacy" in the address bar. On the displayed page, choose "Cookies" followed by "Manage data."

### Get proxy from Gologin

Gologin offers built-in proxies at the level of top-tier providers on the market. Simply select a country or city, and the proxy is automatically assigned to your profile. All three of the most popular proxy types are available—mobile, residential, and data center. You only pay for the traffic directly in the app via the “Buy Proxy” menu. Prices range from $7.5 to $4.5 per GB, depending on the volume.

### Organize profiles with status and folders

Group profiles into folders and statuses to make them easier to manage and work with faster. You’ll see how many profiles are in each group and can move them with drag-and-drop one by one or in bulk. To enable grouping, click the gear icon next to the profile table headers on the right.

### Reorder profiles with Drag-n-Drop

To try it, click and hold a profile row with your mouse, drag it to a new location, and release the mouse button. Here are just some ideas on how you can use it: - drag and drop profiles to any position in the table - move a profile into a folder with d-n-d - move multiple profiles at once - and everything works quickly, even with 1000 profiles.

### Manage proxies with proxy page

Making it easier than ever to manage a large number of proxies: monitor, edit, and delete proxies all in one dedicated place. And even more: - Add comments to proxies - Find proxies with errors quickly in a separate folder - Search proxies across all columns

### Run profile from any app with a link

Paste the ‘Run’ link into the place where you manage profiles, such as spreadsheets, CRM, Discord and just click it to run the profile. Additionally, here’s a tip: you can create a ‘Run profile’ icon on your desktop using the link.

### Share profiles granularly

In Gologin, you can either invite a user to your workspace or share just a single profile. Profile sharing works like Google Docs — you can share one document without giving access to the entire folder. You can choose permissions, pause the link or delete it entirely.

### Run profiles on Gologin server

You can run profiles in the cloud — meaning the profile runs on a server instead of your computer. This saves your computer’s resources, and you can launch profiles from any device, even if Gologin isn’t installed, using the web app.

### What is account warmup?

Account warmup is the process of establishing a new account’s legitimacy on social media platforms or other services by gradually engaging with the platform in a way that mimics organic user behavior.

### Why do I need to warmup my accounts and profiles?

1. To Ease the Registration Process: Avoid CAPTCHAs and phone number verification.
2. To Avoid Detection: Platforms use algorithms to detect abnormal or automated behavior. Sudden bursts of activity on a new account may look like bot behavior, leading to restrictions or bans.
3. To Build Trust: Gradually warming up an account helps establish credibility and trust with the platform, showing that it's being used by a real person.
4. To Prepare for Later Activity: For marketers, bot operators, or multi-account managers, the warmup ensures that the accounts are ready for higher-volume actions like posting, messaging, or interacting with other users without getting flagged.

### Here's the general outline of the warmup process:

We recommend finding communities of people that work with the particular site to get the most relevant and up-to-date advice. However, we have a general recommendation for the account warmup.

### 1. Warmup cookies in your browser profile before registration.

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in your browser that track behavior across websites. Platforms use cookies to track user sessions, and some will flag an account if it’s behaving abnormally or inconsistently. If you create a new browser profile and try to register on a site without any previous history (cookies), it may trigger the detection systems. Here's how to prepare cookies in your profile: 1. After a Gologin browser profile creation, visit the site you are interested in. 2. Spend 5 to 30 minutes gathering cookies before registering. 1. Visit the homepage. 2. Click on a few different sections (blog, product pages, news, etc.). 3. Scroll through the content as if you’re interested. 4. Read articles, view a few posts, or watch videos. This interaction will generate cookies and make you look like a regular user.

### 2. Register the account naturally.

With the cookies in place, proceed to register your new account. Make sure to use quality ISP static proxies. Avoid using VPNs or data center proxies.

### 3. Warmup your account.

If you start performing actions like posting, selling, or sending DMs right after creating the account, it will most likely trigger the red flags, as that’s not typical organic user behavior. Warming up the account for such actions usually takes several days. You can interpret the actions below on any type of website. Here's how it usually goes for social media as an example: 1. Day 1-3: Perform basic actions like scrolling through feeds, liking a few posts, and following a few users. You can also just browse the site without any active interactions. Don’t do too much too quickly. 2. Day 3-5: Continue with light activity but increase slightly. Like more posts, leave a few comments, watch videos or stories, and click on links. Avoid repetitive actions. 3. Day 6-10: Follow a few more accounts each day, send a couple of direct messages (DMs), and continue liking and commenting. Spread activity throughout the day.

### Notes:

Again, there's no golden rule for warming up accounts across all websites. You can find the most effective way only via the trial and error. - Some sites may need a lot more time to gather cookies. - Others may need a "resting" period for your cookies, where you leave the profiles untouched for a few days before registering. - In some cases, 3-7 days of light activity may be required before you can perform high-volume actions without getting flagged.

### More tips!

1. Avoid Spamming: Avoid repetitive patterns, as platforms track suspicious behavior. For instance, don't like or comment on too many posts in rapid succession. 2. Do not automate activities too early: Any automation scripts or should be used sparingly and only after the account is well established. 3. Stay consistent with human behavior: Ensure you’re active at varied times and avoid staying active 24/7. This creates a more realistic pattern. Vary the time intervals between actions. If automations are used, make sure to emulate the mouse movements and pauses. 4. Maximize the success chance: Make sure to use all the available information about the settings and measures on how to not get banned.

### Essential Tips for Guaranteed Success

Whether you're working on Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, Google, or Reddit, these best practices can help you manage accounts effectively and avoid bans.

#### 1. Use high-quality static residential proxies (ISP) for social media or e-commerce.

There are many proxy providers available, but **if you plan to use accounts long-term, make sure to choose a static or long-lasting IP with a good reputation**. This will help ensure the security and reliability of your accounts.

#### 2. Warmup your Browser Profiles and Accounts.

**[Warming up](http://support.gologin.com/en/articles/9923358-account-warmup)** refers to gradually interacting with social media platforms or other services to establish a new account's legitimacy. By mimicking organic user behavior, this process helps prevent accounts from being flagged.

#### 3. Use one proxy per Browser Profile.

The purpose of Gologin browser profiles is for your browsers to appear as different users. The IP of your profile plays a crucial role in that process. **Sharing proxies across multiple profiles can lead to detection.**

#### 4. Do not change the User-Agent manually.

In contrary to the common beliefs, **it should not change every time you create a new profile**. Using multiple profiles with the same user agent will not result in bans.

#### 5. Match the Browser Profile's operating system with your device's OS.

While you can change the operating system in the browser profile, it's best to keep it consistent with your device's OS. **Some sites can detect discrepancies and may flag your account or restrict access.**

#### 6. Keep your Browser Profile's screen resolution in line with your actual screen.

If a site detects mismatched screen resolution settings, it may become suspicious. To avoid this, make sure the screen resolution of your browser profiles does not exceed the resolution of your actual monitor.

#### 7. Use the latest Gologin app and Orbita browser versions.

Websites expect users to have up-to-date browsers, as Chrome typically updates automatically for most users. **Keeping your Gologin app and Orbita browser updated ensures you stay aligned with website expectations.**

#### 8. Do your research on how to work with the particular site.

Account management and creation strategies vary depending on the platform. Detection systems are constantly evolving, so it's essential to stay informed.

**Step 3: Specify the Workspace destination**

Lastly, specify the target Workspace where you want to transfer the selected profiles, or the email address of the target Workspace where you want to transfer the selected profiles.

### Notes on Running Profiles in the Cloud

There are a few things to note, however, with regards to this feature:

#### 1. Forever Free Plan Limitations

Because of the bandwidth and server resources required, "Run in Cloud" is not available on the Forever Free plan.

#### 2. Web Version Behavior

When you are using the Web version of GoLogin at app.gologin.com - any profile you launch will always Run in Cloud. As such, due to note #1 above - if you are on the Forever Free plan, you will not be able to run profiles from the Web version.

#### 3. Profile Setup for Cloud Use

Profiles that are set up for Cloud use should be created as Linux profiles, and it's best to not use such profiles cross-platform if possible.

### Profile Creation

If you use a Linux computer when working with the GoLogin desktop app, then the app will automatically create new profiles in the desktop as Linux profiles. If you use Windows or Mac, then you will need to manually select Linux as the OS for your profile during profile creation.

#### Using the Add Profile Button

You must use the "Add Profile" button shown here - using the simple + button at the top of the profile list will not let you set an OS.

## Transferring Profiles | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/5460884-transferring-profiles

In GoLogin, you can transfer the ownership of your profile to another GoLogin account. It is simple to transfer profiles from one account to another using the "Sharing" option. The same extensions, tabs, fingerprints, cookies, proxy settings, and local storage data are kept when you move a browser profile to another account.

Any plan's user can share their profile with another plan's user. The profile of a team member may be sent to or received from them.

**The sharing function's characteristics**

- Move profiles both individually and in bulk;
- The sender's account will not have the profile removed;
- The receiver will get an email to let them know.

# **Profile Transfer**

1. Find the profile you want to share in the list.
2. Click on the three dots Menu to the right and select the **"Sharing"** function.
3. In the **"Invite someone"** section, type the profile's recipient's email address.
4. Select the access rights for the user (view, edit, admin or owner) and click **"Invite"**.

The invitation will be sent to the specified email. Keep in mind that once you do that, a person you have shared the profile with will be a new owner of this profile, meaning that you can lose all the rights to this profile.

# **Bulk Sharing of Browser Profiles**

1. Open the list of profiles.
2. Select the profile or profiles you want to share.
3. Click the **“Share Profiles”** button.
4. Enter the email address of the recipient of the profile in the **"Invite someone"** field.
5. Click the **"Send invite"** button.

The invitations will be sent to the specified emails. Keep in mind that once you do that, a person you have shared the profile with will be a new owner of this profile, meaning that you can lose all the rights to this profile.

# **Hardware fingerprints can be modified**

Websites may find that fingerprint hashes are incompatible between sessions. This occurs when a different user accesses hardware fingerprints on a different device while they are in Add Noise mode.

**Important:** _The extra noise is always present, but it is added as a filter to the device fingerprint that already exists. Therefore, the resultant fingerprint value will likewise vary if the device has been modified._

You can use the following options if you require identical and unaltered fingerprints to use a browser profile safely on various devices:

1. Execute Gologin profile migration on virtual machines (VMs) with similar configurations or on a VPS with Canvas set to "Add Noise." The same Canvas footprint will remain on several devices because these computers will all be set up in exactly the same ways.
2. Run Gologin using the same model, hardware, driver, and operating system-equipped PCs. The switched prints will remain the same between runs of sessions because these devices will share the same hardware.
3. Run Gologin on comparable Mac computers. The same reasoning as in the second point, but utilizing Mac gadgets makes it easier for you to "fit in with the crowd." Given the mechanical similarity of Mac machines, their Canvas fingerprints are not only quite similar to one another, but the Canvas hash will typically be the same for all similar-model Mac devices.

### Why do I need a UDP proxy?

At the moment, there is a problem that the available anti-detection tools do not provide complete anonymity cause many sites have begun to use the **STUN** ( **Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)** protocol, which is used in WebRTC and **detects your real IP**, into their anti-fraud systems. As a result, this leads to a ban on your account.

We solved the problem one of the first through the introduction of **UDP** ( **User Datagram Protocol)**, on which STUN is based. Now, if you use a UDP-enabled proxy, you can be calm about passing antifraud on our product!  

* * *  

_It should be noted that UDP currently only works with **Socks5 proxies with UDP support**, other connection methods will **not** work_  

* * *

### How do I know if my proxy supports WebRTC UDP?

Go to [iphey.com](http://iphey.com/) and look at the **WebRTC STUN** parameter. (there should be the IP address of your request server or yours if you start without asking)

The browser, depending on the parameters of the request, choose needed the mode for work by itself.

​ **Options can be:**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ### Proxy type | ### Checking JS API | ### Checking STUN |
| **SOCKS5 with UDP support** | Shows IP of the proxy server | Shows IP of the proxy server |
| **SOCKS5 without UDP support** | WebRTC disabled | WebRTC disabled |
| **HTTP** | WebRTC disabled | WebRTC disabled |
| **No proxy** | Shows your IP | Shows your IP |

### API Options (npm package)

The parameter is added to **preference** in profile startup

```
gologin_webrtc_enable: Boolean
```

​ **Remains support for the old format:**

​ **Mode: disable** \- WebRTC is disabled.

​ **Mode: !disable** \- any value other than disable, WebRTC is enabled.

### User-Agent Information

User-Agent is a set of information about your setup that sites or services request from your browser. It consists of the information about the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent. It should not change every time you create a new profile. Using multiple profiles with the same user agent will not result in bans. There are only so many combinations of the OS + browser version. Since we recommend using the same OS in the profile as your device OS and the latest browser version, ideally, you always should have the same user agent. Please do not change the User Agent manually! We change lots of things every time you create a new browser profile, so every new profile will have a unique fingerprint without changing the user agent!

### Changing Browser Version

You cannot change the browser version of the existing browser profile. You can only update it to the newest available version. However, you can choose the browser version upon the profile creation, in the Advanced section of the menu.

### Opening Multiple Profiles

We do not restrict the number of profiles you can open locally at your device. You can open as many profiles as the device can handle. It depends on how powerful your desktop is, the speed and latency of your network and a few other things. Usually, our customers can open 10 or more profiles at once without any issues. However, there are limitations on opening the profiles in Cloud at app.gologin.com.

### Browser Support

We do not currently have other browsers apart from the Orbita, our custom browser, based on Chrome.

### Operating System Settings

Should I set a different operating system in my browser profile?

### Profile Data Is Gone

If you've opened your profile and found your last session hasn't been saved, remember if you waited till the profile got synced before you closed the GoLogin app itself.

Always wait till the button " **Run**" turns **green**. Otherwise, you risk ending up losing all the data your profiles have.

If you are sure you waited, take the following steps:

- Click the three dots next to the button "Run" of a profile that doesn't have the last session saved.
- Click "Edit".
- Go to the "Advanced" section.
- Scroll down to the part called "Other".
- Make sure all the saving functions are enabled.

## WebRTC Profile Settings | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/3453362-webrtc-profile-settings

WebRTC, known as a browser plugin, is commonly used for website applications that require a quick, straight-forward connection. As WebRTC creates a connection through the UDP protocol, the link should not be routed via proxy servers utilized in browsers. Websites have to be put into service in revealing the actual public IP address and local IP address, even when a proxy is available. Also, a similar plugin should be used to retrieve local IP address and locate media devices.

# Type of Plugin Leaks from WebRTC:
- Public IP address
- Local IP address
- Number and Hash of Media Devices

# Modes of WebRTC
- **Altered** Mode – both Public IP and Local IP of WebRTC are changed.
- **Disabled** Mode – plugins of WebRTC used in browsers are disabled.
- **Real** Mode – plugins of WebRTC are enabled and reveal your actual IP address.

# Altered Mode Configuration
The altered mode of WebRTC configures both local and public IP addresses in launching browser profile. Addresses should be equivalent to the IP of browser profile configuration.

# Public IP Address
The course of action ‘fill on start based on external IP’ defines that the browser profile will connect first to a server when launched. The real WebRTC external IP is easily detected. Therefore, it would be better to return and then configure the WebRTC Public IP. Every period, IP addresses will change, by then WebRTC Public IP instantly adjusts corresponding to its changes.

If option is left disabled, it means WebRTC Public IP is already manually configured.

# Local IP Addresses
As users tap on ‘new browser profile’ or ‘get new fingerprint’, the browser will generate local IP addresses. Users can configure it manually. However, some browser profile does not allow local IP address configuration.

# Valid Local IP Ranges
Local IP addresses need to be within the range to make it valid. The considered valid range is:
- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

It is common for users in the residences to have 0 in their third digit or at block C, and arbitrary numbers on the 4th or block D. Meanwhile, those users in a company obtain another set of numbers other than 0 on block C and D.

# Local IP for residences example:
- 192.168.0.21
- 172.16.0.168

# Corporate Local IP example:
- 192.168.31.123
- 172.16.11.22

### Do I need to change any settings?

If the profile is already created and the location is selected, no extra actions are needed. Just start the profile and use it like a regular browser.

### I created a profile and added a proxy. Is that all?

Yes, after that, you can start the profile and use it.

### Do I have to use a proxy?

Yes, we recommend using a unique proxy for each profile. This is important for security. Gologin provides built-in residential proxies with 2 GB of data included in each paid plan. The trial plan includes 500 MB of residential proxies.

### Can I open different websites in the same profile?

Yes, you can open different websites in one profile. Each profile acts like a separate device, so you can use it just like a normal browser.

### Can multiple people use the same profile at the same time?

No, we have a setting that prevents a profile from being opened twice. This helps keep your account secure and prevents multiple users from accessing the same profile at the same time.

### Can I open multiple profiles at once?

Yes, you can open as many profiles as your computer can handle. Usually, even weak computers can run up to 10 profiles without issues.

### Can my virtual assistant continue from where I left off?

Yes, your virtual assistant will see the same tabs, stay logged into the same accounts, and have access to the browser history.

### Will my tabs stay open?

Yes, tabs will be saved.

### Will I stay logged in?

Yes, you will stay logged in.

### Will cookies be saved?

Yes, cookies will be saved.

### Is everything included in the plan?

Yes, all paid plans include 2 GB of high-quality residential proxies. The trial plan includes 500 MB of residential proxies. All other features, including fingerprint spoofing, are also included in the paid plan and available in the trial version.

### What is the difference between sharing a profile and inviting someone to a team?

When you share a profile, the person sees only that profile in their workspace and cannot access any other profiles. When you invite someone to your team, they see all your profiles. If you want them to see only specific profiles, you can add them to a folder instead. However, they will still be part of your team. When sharing a profile, they work in their own workspace and only see the profile you shared with them.

### What is the difference between workspaces and folders?

Workspaces contain folders. Folders are inside workspaces.

### Do Chrome extensions work?

Yes, all Chrome Store extensions work in Gologin. You can add them from our catalog or upload your own extension.

### What is the best way to install extensions?

You can install extensions through the profile settings or upload your own manually.

### Troubleshooting

- Turn off the Threat Protection feature in NordVPN to prevent IP leaks.

## Automation of the Processes With Selenium | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/6627572-automation-of-the-processes-with-selenium

With some moves that take too much unnecessary effort, using **Selenium** to automate tasks can become a convenient way to minimize the workload. With its help the user scripts the scenario that should be executed to automate web browser routine.

The specifics of **GoLogin** allow it to run the **Selenium browser codes** with the Google driver software. To set up the [Selenium](https://gologin.com/browser-automation-withs-selenium) browser automation, first search for github.com/gologinapp/gologin repository, selenium directory.

For automated website interaction, the most convenient coding language is Python, as it provides reliable technical support in case of trouble. However, in general, because of multiple specific interactions, the Selenium framework operates with many existing language bindings.

To get started, open the driver to insert the necessary information. The [code for Selenium browser](https://gologin.com/using-selenium-with-gologin) in Python has such structure:

```python
import time

from sys import platform

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from gologin import GoLogin

gl = GoLogin({
    'token': 'yU0token',
    'profile_id': 'yU0Pr0f1leiD',
})

if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":
    chrome_driver_path = './chromedriver'
elif platform == "darwin":
    chrome_driver_path = './mac/chromedriver'
elif platform == "win32":
    chrome_driver_path = 'chromedriver.exe'

debugger_address = gl.start()

chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_experimental_option("debuggerAddress", debugger_address)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path, options=chrome_options)
driver.get("http://www.python.org")

assert "Python" in driver.title
driver.close()
time.sleep(3)
gl.stop()
```

**Especially important are the following points:**
1. Creation of GoLogin class instance, which specifies access token and profile for running the command.
2. Launching remote brother, transmission of obtained links to Selenium.
3. Opening python.org for making sure the command was set correctly.

Note. _After the command application for Selenium, close browser driver and initiate the profile stop for the correct setup process._

In order to ease the work with Selenium web browser automation, the extensions can be used as a convenient management tool. The examples of such, supported by GoLogin, can be found below, and, if necessary – installed from the Chrome store.

### The Mechanism Behind Geolocation Retrieval

Due to the dynamic nature of IP address locations, browsers rely on continuously updated databases to accurately determine geolocation. Chrome and Firefox, for instance, utilize the Google Maps API to fetch a user's precise location. This process involves transmitting data like the user's IP address and nearby WiFi.

### Geolocation Settings in Gologin

Gologin, through its Orbita browser, allows users to manipulate geolocation settings, offering three distinct modes: Request, Allow, and Block. Each mode provides a different level of geolocation data sharing with websites. - **Prompt Mode (Default)**: In this mode, the browser asks the user via a pop-up whether to share their geolocation with a requesting site, mirroring the "request permission to access" setting seen from the website's perspective. Consent results in the browser sending the set coordinates to the site. - **Allow Mode**: This setting automatically approves all geolocation requests from websites, signaling that the user consents to share their location data, which is then transmitted from the browser's profile settings to the requesting sites. - **Block Mode**: Here, all requests for geolocation data are automatically declined, with websites receiving a notice that the request has been blocked by the user's browser settings.

### Choosing the Right Geolocation Setting

To maintain credibility and trustworthiness with websites, it's often recommended to allow geolocation access. This is especially useful for services that require location data to function correctly, such as mapping services. However, it's essential to be mindful of privacy and the potential for websites to cross-reference geolocation data with other information, such as IP addresses.

### Automatically Geolocating Settings

Gologin defaults to using the "Set geolocation coordinates based on IP address" setting. When enabled, Gologin connects to its servers using the profile's specified connection settings, transmitting the real external IP address. Subsequently, Gologin consults the Ip2Geo database for corresponding coordinates, applying a minor, consistent random adjustment to avoid identical locations for IPs from the same ISP. These adjusted coordinates are then consistently used in the user's profile, ensuring that websites receive a reliable geolocation signal tailored to the user's settings.

### Sharing a folder

Granting a user access to a shared folder gives them varying degrees of freedom within the entire folder.

#### How to share a folder:

1. Go to the **main dropdown menu** at the top-right
2. Hit **Invite members**
3. Type in your colleague's **email for GoLogin account**
4. Select access to the folders you would like the person to get:
   - **Can run**— the user can **view** and **run** the profiles in the folder you shared
   - **Can edit** — the user can **run**, **clone**, **create new** profiles and **edit** the settings of the profiles in the folder
   - **Full access**— the same as **edit** but also can **re-share** folders
5. Click **Send invite**!

#### Accessing a shared folder

In GoLogin, when you share a folder, you effectively share access to a part of your workspace. Meaning that when you share a folder, your teammate won't be able to see it in their own workspace.

#### Switching between workspaces:

1. Navigate to the **main dropdown menu** at the top-right
2. If you have workspaces or folders shared to you, you should see the additional workspace in the list. **Click on the** **workspace** to access it.
3. You are now in the workspace where the shared folder is. You can navigate to it just by **clicking on the folder** at the top of the window.
   **Note:** if you've been added to multiple folders inside a single workspace, you can see all the profiles from them at once on the **All profiles** tab.

#### What you can see / change

You have access to the statuses, notes, tags and other profile parameters. You might or might not change them according to your privileges. The changes are synced between users, however, you will need to update the page by clicking on the folder name to see the changes.

#### Proxies in shared folders

You can see and change proxies in the existing profiles but you won't get access to the owner's proxy list.

### Additional API Information

For complete API documentation and examples, refer to the official GoLogin API documentation at https://docs.gologin.com/

### Configuration Details

All configuration options are accessible through the profile settings interface or via the GoLogin API.

### Usage Guidelines

Refer to the best practices section for detailed usage instructions and recommendations.

### Troubleshooting Resources

For additional troubleshooting help, visit the GoLogin support center or contact support directly.

### Frequently Asked Questions

For more FAQ answers, visit the GoLogin support center at https://support.gologin.com/

### Fonts Settings

Fonts fingerprinting stands for detecting the digital identity based on what fonts the user has and how they are drawn inside their browser. Websites mainly use 2 technologies to get your fonts list: 1. Measuring font metrics, which is close to the Canvas fingerprinting in the way it works; 2. Fonts list enumeration, which is done through the CSS introspection.

#### Disabling Font Masking

The font masking is enabled by default. But if you want to disable it, you must do the following: 1. Click the three dots next to the "Run" button of a profile. 2. Click "Setting". 3. Go to the "Advanced" section. 4. Scroll down until you see this.

#### Changing Navigator Language

The “Navigator language” property contains information about the system language. This identification method is not dangerous and is often used to determine localization settings, but it can also be used to detect differences between the api and the browser language. This information is extracted from the http header “except language” which the client sends to the Gologin server. Automatically installs your language according to your IP, but you can also change it manually.

#### Saving Language Settings

In order to understand whether the site sees our profile correctly, it is necessary: 1. Save the settings using the “Save” button. 2. Launch the profile using the “Run” button.

### Sharing a profile

If you share access to a profile to a user, they get access with a full set of your settings, such as: cookies, local storage and extensions (if enabled), tabs, proxy settings, browser settings, and fingerprint configs.

#### To share a profile, here's what you need to do:

1. Hover over the three dots next to the button **Run** of a profile
2. Select **Share** in the drop-down window
3. Type the email of the teammate's account
4. Select their role:
   ​ **Can run**— the user can **view** and **run** the profiles you shared
   **Can edit** — the user can **run**, **clone**, and **edit** the settings of the profiles you shared
   **Full access**— the same as **edit** but also can **share** profiles
5. Click **Share**!

### What is the limit and how is it counted?

You can review the limits for your subscription plan [here](https://gologin.com/pricing/). We count one instance of sharing a profile to someone as a sharing. For example: if you share **2 profiles to 5 people** or **10 profiles to a single colleague**, in both cases it will use up 10 sharings.

### Can I restore my sharings? What if I need to change them?

In terms of how plans work, only current sharings are counted. It means that if you have shared your profiles 10 times and then unshared 2, you will have 2 more sharings again.

### Code Examples

```
import time

from sys import platform

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from gologin import GoLogin

gl = GoLogin({
    'token': 'yU0token',
    'profile_id': 'yU0Pr0f1leiD',
})

if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":
    chrome_driver_path = './chromedriver'
elif platform == "darwin":
    chrome_driver_path = './mac/chromedriver'
elif platform == "win32":
    chrome_driver_path = 'chromedriver.exe'

debugger_address = gl.start()

chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_experimental_option("debuggerAddress", debugger_address)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path, options=chrome_options)
driver.get("http://www.python.org")

assert "Python" in driver.title
driver.close()
time.sleep(3)
gl.stop()
```

## Geolocation Modes | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/3453364-geolocation-modes

# Geolocation Modes

GoLogin provides coordinate customization of the geolocation to website. Mask modes are available for geolocation: allow, block, prompt.

## Prompt Mode
When websites make an appeal to receive coordinates, browsers send pop-up windows confirming whether the user wants to pass on the geolocation towards the website. On the perspective of the website, users configure settings into ‘ask before access’ on browser setting.

Users have to enable the recovery of the geolocation. By that, geolocation coordinates on browser profile setting is given to website.

## Allow Mode
Geolocation is passed on automatically to the websites that are on request. On the perspective of the website, users need to configure the automatic feature to allow location readout on browser setting.

## Block Mode
Most of the websites are automatically blocked, they cannot receive geolocation coordinates. On the perspective of the website, it can determine that the feature is configured to block the location readout on browser settings.

## Correct Geolocation Masking Mode
When users allow the websites to determine their geolocation, the trust is increased. Users need to remember that these websites determines the geolocation coordinates on one page, by then websites will use user information and compare it towards another location-revealing data points on other pages.

### Automatic Geolocation
Users will notice by default the fill geolocation based on IP option is turned on. Users who use this feature will notice that GoLogin tries to connect to its own servers through the configured connection in the settings of the browser profile. When users successfully connect it, backends are recognized to the real external IP address, even other websites sees it.

Retrieval of geolocation coordinates originates from an up to date Ip2Geo database. Users can prevent using the same coordinates for multiple IP address that belong to a similar ISP. GoLogin will randomly add small offsets to the coordinates. Offsets is acknowledged and remains consistent on the browser profile.

Authorized websites can receive the geolocation.

### Manual Geolocation
When users decide disabling the automatic setup for geolocation coordinates on the external IP, users have to manually fill up a form and enter geolocation coordinates.

Format of Geolocation coordinate must be in Decimal Degrees (DD) format.

- Latitude and Longitudes are the coordinates
- Accuracy is the precision of the coordinates in meters, the reference range is 1 to 1-100. In GoLogin, the multiples of 10 are reduced to provide convenient use.

### Browser optimization

To identify users, several websites utilize various browser fingerprinting techniques. Certain browser settings will work well for some websites while others will have the opposite impact. In Gologin, you may pick and choose whatever websites you wish to use. Our application automatically adapts its internal mechanics to work with your target websites.

We advise you to pick only the websites you intend to use, even though you have the option of selecting numerous. Such a targeted approach is projected to produce a more fruitful result. It eliminates the potential for settings to conflict and do more harm than benefit.

### Timezone Profile Settings

There are two methods for a website to define your timezone. The first way is, the website parses the IP address via the database of Ip2Geo. The next method uses the JavaScript function. It reads the timezone through the API browser found at the regional settings of the operating system. The results of the methods will be checked by the browser. If the results do not match, the user must be using a proxy server's location set in a different timezone.

With GoLogin, users can configure the time zone of the browser profile automatically or manually.

#### Choose Timezone Automatically

Allow option "fill time zone based on the IP" to immediately join within the primary servers through GoLogin. The servers will go through connections that were already existing in the settings of the browser profile. Once the servers are connected, the backend can recognize those other websites that have the same external IP address.

#### Choose Timezone Manually

Users have the ability to manually set the timezone. They can disable the feature "fill timezone based on the IP", and fill in the configuration form manually. After disabling, the operator can select the timezone value he or she wants.

## Profile Import & Export

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/5771836-profile-import-export

GoLogin supports both profile import and export. In other words, you may import ready-made digital identities into GoLogin or, vice versa, export them from our software.

To do that, you need to use a CSV (comma-separated values) file — a text file that uses a comma to separate values, with each line of the file being a data record.

If you want to import digital identities from other platforms into GoLogin, you must do as follows:

- Prepare CSV files containing digital identities.
- Click "Import" at the top of the app, right next to "Folders".
- Choose or drag a CSV file.

_A part of the CSV sample of a macOS M1 profile:_

If you want to export digital identities from GoLogin, the following steps must be taken:

- Click the checkbox of a profile you want to export.
- Click "Export" popping up above.

### Profile Import

To import digital identities from other platforms into GoLogin, you must do as follows:

- Prepare CSV files containing digital identities.
- Click "Import" at the top of the app, right next to "Folders".
- Choose or drag a CSV file.

### Profile Export

If you want to export digital identities from GoLogin, the following steps must be taken:

- Click the checkbox of a profile you want to export.
- Click "Export" popping up above.

### How to restore your profiles:

1. Open the dropdown menu at the top right
2. Navigate to Settings & Members
3. Go to the Restore profiles tab
4. Look for the profiles that needs recovering

### Creating profiles

You can create your profiles in several different ways:

#### Quick Profile Creation

Use the **+** button for default profile settings

#### Custom Profile Creation

Use the **Add Profile** button to modify settings

#### Bulk Profile Creation

Create multiple profiles at once

### 1. Creating a Quick Profile

1. Navigate to the main page by clicking the **All Profiles** button
2. Click the **+** button at the top-left. The profile will have the same settings as your **Default Profile Settings**

### 2. Creating and Editing a Profile

1. Click the **Add Profile** button at the top-right
2. The profile will be created, and the parameters window will open automatically
3. You can edit the settings or simply click **Create Profile** to use the default settings

#### Settings You Can Change

1. **Choosing the OS.** It is the OS that your profile will represent to the sites. It is **highly recommended** to use the same operating system as the native of the device.
2. **Setting up the proxy**. You can use third-party proxy options. Just paste the proxy details into the corresponding fields in the **Proxy** > **Your proxy** tab.
3. **Advanced Settings**. For most use cases, the default settings are sufficient. However, you can proceed to the **Advanced settings** to further calibrate your profile if needed.

### 3. Creating multiple profiles in bulk

In GoLogin, you can create up to 30 profiles at once. Most of the settings will be by default, some of them you will get to change right after the profile creation.

#### Steps to Create Multiple Profiles

1. Locate the **arrow** pointing down, it's next to the Add profile, and click it
2. Choose the number of profiles to create
3. Click the **Add multiple profiles** button

### What Is WebGL?

A technique called **WebGL**(Web-based Graphics Library) allows 3D pictures to be rendered in browsers. Typically, WebGL fingerprint is used on websites where, for example, it is possible to work with 3D shapes. However, the technology can also be used to identify the user. Websites can typically do this using one of two methods:

1. The whole WebGL Browser Report table is retrieved and looked at in WebGL Report. For quicker examination, it is sometimes transformed into a hash.

2. A concealed 3D image is rendered and hashed using WebGL. This method produces distinct numbers for various combinations of devices and their drivers since the final result depends on a physical device that performs computations.

### Web GL Test

The Web GL test page by [Browserleaks](https://browserleaks.com/webgl) allows you to test WebGL and see what data the websites can retrieve using this API.

### What is Web GL Metadata and Image Modes in GoLogin

Any web browser transmits a huge amount of metadata: what maximum size a drawn shape can take, the maximum number of polygons, how many bit colors are supported, and other necessary information that websites use to render shapes. This very technology can also be secretly used to collect data about devices that are responsible for graphics on your PC.

In Gologin, you may choose to let the website see the actual fingerprint of your device or add permanent random noise to the readout to regulate WebGL readouts.

### Noise Mode for WebGL Images

**WebGL Image** is that very 3D image that is rendered. The WebGL fingerprinting is similar to Canvas: the website renders a shape, gets an identifier, and then compares it with other Internet users. Usually the pyramid is rendered, colored in a gradient, because it covers enough points — it has both height and depth, and width and length.

**Noise** — WebGL Image will be masked by applying a unique and persistent noise. There's no confirmed information about web sites actually utilizing this parameter for browser fingerprinting.

This enables the creation of a distinctive fingerprint that endures for a certain browser profile.

**Off**— renders according to the data that is in the metada (see WebGL Metadata). Don't mask WebGL Image. There's no confirmed information about web sites actually utilizing this parameter for browser fingerprinting.

### WebGL Metadata Masking Mode

**Mask**— substitutes values based on the created digital fingerprint. Replace WebGL metadata with alternative suitable values. Recommended for most use cases.

In "Other WebGL parameters," you can view modified WebGL metadata parameters:

**Off**— transfers the real values of your PC. Don't mask WebGL Metadata. Websites will see real WebGL parameters of your computer. There is no solid proof that websites actively use the WebGL option to identify users' browsers.

In some circumstances, where websites react poorly to 100% unique WebGL readouts, switching the option to Off can be useful.

### WebGL settings Vendor and Render

**WebGL Vendor** is a company that supplied a video card to another legal entity who installed a video card into a PC. In other words, it is a video card vendor.

**WebGL Renderer** — the user's video card, with the help of which the video is rendered (for example, GTX 1080).

### Enumeration of Multimedia Devices

The enumeration of devices solely rely on the retrieval of the complete list of numbers for the multimedia devices installed. However, how many multimedia devices is insufficient to specifically identify the user. But, it has an important role.

Remember: Enumerating the number of multimedia devices is only for those users that have the premium subscriptions.

Altering the given parameters is possible as long as it follows the boundaries:

- Video inputs (Cameras available): 0 to 1
- Audio inputs (Microphones available): 0 to 4
- Audio outputs (Speakers available): 0 to 4

In technical references, users can use more of the limited amount of devices. However, the scenario is unusual. Device numbers are always in limitation in accordance to most online users are using.

### Tracking IDs for Media Device

In making WebRTC work, the website has to determine the number and the type of multimedia devices used. Through this, users has the ability to build correct real-time communication that needs a unique device identifier. Moreover, users need to think of the device address. The browsers will not give an authorization to the websites that enables them to view the full model of the hardware devices. However, the browsers give hashes. These hashes are termed as Device IDs. Similarly, these websites use values for user identification purposes.

The IDs of media devices are unique to each user. It has an outstanding and effective technique for browser fingerprinting. When the feature in GoLogin is enable, it masks the device IDs for the devices you added.

Remember: As users turn off the mask for the multimedia devices, the real IDs of the device are revealed on the website. Moreover, this will happen when you enable the IP masking on WebRTC.

### AudioContext Modes

AudioContext GoLogin can be found in the " **Advanced**" section of the profile settings:

#### Noise

adds noise and slightly changes its values.

#### Off

conveys your real data (many users with a similar PC model will have the same values, so do not worry that you are not hiding this data — it is simply impossible to track down a certain user in such a huge crowd).

### Custom DNS Profile Settings

Proxies of some providers can give out the IP addresses of your dns servers in addition, some services through their partner dns servers allow you to track your actual address. Users can check the leakage of DNS servers on these best websites: - [iphey.com](https://iphey.com/) - [whoer.net](https://whoer.net/) - [browserleaks.com](https://browserleaks.com/) In case you want to stop the potential leaks you can define another custom DNS server through the [settings of the browser profile](https://support.gologin.com/en/collections/3069861-profile-management). To do this in Gologin follow the steps: 1. Access the side settings by pressing the "Settings" button on the profile; 2. Navigate to the Proxy & Location tab and start adding your Custom DNS; Remember that the custom dns will only work with a VPN direct connection or SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxy. Users must provide the address of a real DNS server to assign a custom DNS. You can use public DNS servers, but those corresponding to your public IP address by location are recommended.

### Troubleshooting

- If you can't find the lost profiles, try looking for them by the profile name using the search feature or contact support for assistance.

### FAQ

- Profiles deleted more than 120 hours ago cannot be restored.

## Enabling your web camera | GoLogin Help Center

**Source:** https://support.gologin.com/en/articles/8390633-enabling-your-web-camera

By default, GoLogin masks your media devices, and access to your computer's real webcam(s) is turned off. This is done to keep identifying data (such as the amount of media devices attached to your computer, your device's local IP address, etc) inaccessible to websites you visit through GoLogin.

It's important to note that if you choose to follow the instructions below and disable masking, your internal IP address may become accessible to any websites you visit, subsequently lowering your anonymity and possibly compromising your fingerprint, in some cases.

Webcam access is available only when using Gologin through our dedicated Mac OS or Windows desktop application. It is not supported in the web-based version of Gologin.

To enable webcam access, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the profile for which you want to change the settings is closed, displaying a "Run" button.

2. Hover your cursor over the profile name and click on Settings.

3. In the side menu, select "Hardware" and change the "Media Devices" value from "Masked" to "Real".

4. Open the profile and test the webcam functionality!

If you have any additional questions about webcam usage in Gologin, don't hesitate to message our support team!

### Steps to Enable Webcam Access

1. Ensure that the profile for which you want to change the settings is closed, displaying a "Run" button.
2. Hover your cursor over the profile name and click on Settings.
3. In the side menu, select "Hardware" and change the "Media Devices" value from "Masked" to "Real".
4. Open the profile and test the webcam functionality!

### Cloning a Browser Profile

If you need to clone your profile, click the three dots to the right of its button "Run", then "Clone". It's recommended to clone a profile while it's not being run. The new profile will be 100% identical to the one you have cloned.

### Bulk Cloning

You can also clone profiles in bulk by ticking them and then clicking "Clone" above a list of your profiles:

### HARDWARE

“If you get this warning when [checking your browser](https://gologin.com/check-browser), make sure your real **OS** matches **your profile emulation**. For example, if your real OS is **Windows**, it's recommended to run only **Windows** profiles on your PC.

You can still use **macOS/Linux/Android** profiles on **Windows**, if you like. But keep in mind that your masking will be slightly less secure and reliable at this point.

### LOCATION & IP ADDRESS

The warnings concerning your **location** or/and **IP address** always come down to your **proxies**. Make sure you use [high-quality proxies](https://gologin.com/proxy) that cover up your location for certain.

### BROWSER

If the warning regards **browser**, it means that the version of your browser is outdated, might look suspicious and even get you banned on some websites. In order to avoid that, do not forget to **update** GoLogin when you see an update hanging at the top.

Such an issue may also spring out if you're using a **user-agent** having an outdated browser version. On top of that, it may also have some elements of another OS, which may lead to you having 2 warnings at the same time: the **browser** one and the **hardware** one. So, be careful when changing **user-agents** in the "Advanced" section. You must understand what you're doing in order to make consistent, real-looking [fingerprints](https://support.gologin.com/en/collections/3664187-browser-fingerprints).

### Sorting Browser Profiles By Folders

To create a folder, click "Folders" at the top-right corner of the GoLogin app. The following section will be shown:

Here you can create, rename, delete, and even share your folders to other people. If you want to add some profiles to a specific folder, go back to the "Profiles" section, click the three dots next to the button "Run" of a profile, then "Manage In Folders".

### Adding your proxy

Setting up a single or multiple proxies in your browser profiles

### The easiest way

Here, we will cover the most straightforward way, which is the proxy column on your profile page.

#### Step 1

At the **All profiles** page, locate the **Proxy** column and click the **+** button at the profile, which you want to add a proxy to.

#### Step 2

In the opened window, input your **IP, port, username** and **password**. Don't forget to change the protocol from the default **HTTP** to **SOCKS** if your proxy uses it.

#### Step 3

Click **Done**, the proxy is now added to your profile!

### Other ways of adding a single or multiple proxies in bulk

#### Via the proxy manager

Copy a few proxies and paste them all at once into the proxy column at the **All profiles** page. Use your system **hot keys** or the **Paste proxies** button. You will be able to rearrange your new proxies between the profiles later.

#### On the Proxies page

Via the **main menu at the top-right > Proxies > Import proxies**.

#### Using the profile selection

**Select** a few browser **profiles** > click **Proxy** on top > input proxies for them in a new window > click **Update proxy**.

#### In the profile settings

Click **3 dots** on the profile **> Settings > Proxy > Your proxy**.
